# function-rotator
A program that visualizes a given function in 2D and has the ability to rotate it along an axis, to generate a 3D mesh.

### Controls
- **Space** - Toggle the 3D mesh view
- **R** - Toggle automatic rotation
- **L** - Toggle lighting (experimental)
- **M** - Toggle polygon mode / see all polygons drawn transparently
- **Left Mouse Button** - Click and drag to rotate manually
- **Scroll Wheel** - Zoom in and out

### Dependencies:
* [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew)
* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

### Todo
* ~~Indexed rendering for 3D mesh~~
* Choice between axis of rotation
* (Optional) Function parsing instead of hardcoded function
